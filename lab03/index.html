      <h3>Reflection: Lab 02</h3>
      <p>Doing Lab 2 actually made building a simple webpage make sense I put the header, main, article, and footer together and it started to look like a real page. The validator flagged a stray </div> and fixing that taught me to read the errors instead of guessing. I also realized that planning the layout ahead of time makes writing the code much easier. I used my class notes and the W3C Validator, and I’m curious if there’s a faster way to check markup before uploading.</p>

      <h3>Reflection: Lab 03</h3>
      <p>This lab helped me see how much easier it is to control the look of my page using an external stylesheet rather than only inline or internal styles. Linking my style.css to my HTML and using selectors for headings, paragraphs, and links made everything more consistent and easier to update. Adding my second reflection paragraph let me compare what I learned from lab02 to what I’m learning now, and I can really see how my skills are improving. My coworkers were my main resource when I got stuck, and they helped me troubleshoot a couple of small mistakes in my CSS.</p>
