    While creating this project, I learned how to organize my files, create multiple pages, and use simple CSS to make everything look consistent. Some parts were challenging, like making sure all the links worked and keeping everything neat, but practice made it easier.

    Testing the site on different devices showed me how important layout and spacing are. What looks good on a computer may not look good on a phone, so I had to adjust things and make sure the text stayed readable.

    Overall, this class taught me the basics of HTML, CSS, structure, images, tables, links, and simple design. This project helped me put all that knowledge together into something I can build on in the future.
