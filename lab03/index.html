      <h3>Reflection: Lab 02</h3>
      <p>Doing Lab 2 actually made building a simple webpage make sense I put the header, main, article, and footer together and it started to look like a real page. The validator flagged a stray /div and fixing that taught me to read the errors instead of guessing. I also realized that planning the layout ahead of time makes writing the code much easier. I used my class notes and the W3C Validator, and I’m curious if there’s a faster way to check markup before uploading.</p>

      <h3>Reflection: Lab 03</h3>
      <p>While completing Lab 3, I learned how linking an external stylesheet makes it much easier to control and update the look of my whole page at once. Moving my CSS out of the HTML helped me see the difference between content and design more clearly. Adding the second reflection paragraph also gave me a chance to compare what I’ve learned since Lab 2 and notice how my skills have grown. My coworkers were my main resource again, and they helped me troubleshoot small issues in my CSS along the way.</p>
