  While creating this project, I learned how to organize my files, build multiple connected pages, and use CSS to keep everything looking clean and consistent. Some parts were challenging at first, like making sure all the links worked, choosing simple layouts, and keeping my code neat, but it got easier as I practiced and started recognizing patterns.

  Testing the site on different browsers and devices showed me how important spacing and layout really are. Something that looks perfect on a laptop can look squished or uneven on a phone, so I had to adjust text sizes, fix spacing, and make sure everything stayed easy to read no matter the screen size.
  <p>
  Overall, this class taught me the basics of HTML and CSS, including structure, images, lists, tables, links, and simple design principles. Finishing this final project helped me understand how all those pieces fit together to create a full website, and it gave me confidence for building more advanced projects in the future.
